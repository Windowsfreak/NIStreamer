/**
 * This interface defines the identifiers for the different bit stream
 * profiles and progression types.
 *
 * <P>Each progressive type has a different number: 'PT_SNR_PROG',
 * 'PT_RES_PROG', or 'PT_ARB_PROG'. These are the same identifiers are used in
 * the codestream syntax.
 *
 * <P>Each profile identifier is a flag bit. Therefore, several
 * profiles can appear at the same time.
 *
 * <p>This interface defines the constants only. In order to use the constants
 * in any other class you can either use the fully qualified name (e.g.,
 * <tt>ProgressionType.LY_RES_COMP_POS_PROG</tt>) or declare this interface in
 * the implements clause of the class and then access the identifier
 * directly.</p>
