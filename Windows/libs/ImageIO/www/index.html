<h3><a name="How_to_Contribute"></a>How to Contribute</h3>
<p>We invite developers to contribute to Java Advanced Imaging Image
I/O Tools. Please
refer to
the
<a href="https://jai-imageio.dev.java.net/contribute.html">Contributing
to
Java Advanced Imaging Image I/O Tools</a> page in the parent
jai-imageio project to learn
how to contribute to this project or any other Java Advanced Imaging
Image I/O Tools
related
project. See the <a href="https://javadesktop.dev.java.net/govern.html">JavaDesktop
Community Governance Guidelines</a> for general guidelines on

<h3><a name="Reporting_Issues"></a>Reporting Issues<br>
</h3>
<p>We have set up the <a
 href="https://jai-imageio-core.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectIssues">Issue
Tracker</a>
in this
project
to track issues (bugs, feature requests, etc.) for
Java Advanced Imaging Image I/O Tools core implementation related
issues. </p>
<p>The following subcomponents exist in the jai-imageio-core project's
Issue Tracker:<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>build: Issues with the jai-imageio-core build process<br>
  </li>
  <li>implementation: Issues with the implementation for
jai-imageio-core<br>
  </li>
  <li>codeclib: Issues with the native codeclib implementation for
jai-imageio-core<br>
  </li>
  <li>specification: Issues with the jai-imageio-core specification<br>
  </li>
  <li>www: Issues with the jai-imageio-core web pages</li>
  <li>other: Issues that cannot be categorized into any of the above<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Remember
to take a little time when filing a bug report -- make sure you can
reproduce the problem, and be very explicit in your description of the
problem. If there's something you'd like to see and don't, or something
you can imagine being improved, let us know by filing an enhancement
request. Use the project's Issue Tracker and file an "Enhancement"
rather than a "Defect". </p>
<p>This project has its own issues mailing list.&nbsp;<a
 href="https://jai-imageio-core.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectMailingListList">Click
here to subscribe</a> to the issues mailing list described below:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
  <li> <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 238);">issues@jai-imageio-core.dev.java.net</span>
list is for automated issue

<h3><a name="Feedback_and_Discussion"></a>Feedback and Discussion<br>
</h3>
<p>Through the JAI Image I/O forum and mailing lists, people using the
software
can benefit from each others' expertise. To be really useful, the lists
need <i>your</i> input! Please don't be afraid to post -- help out
others when you can; post your questions, comments, and ideas as you
see fit.</p>
<p>We have created four Java Advanced Imaging Image I/O Tools mailing
lists in the
parent <a href="http://jai-imageio.dev.java.net/">jai-imageio</a>
project: </p>
<ul>
  <li> <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 238);">announce@jai-imageio.dev.java.net</span>
  </li>
  <li> <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 238);">interest@jai</span><span
 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 238);">-imageio</span><span
 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 238);">.dev.java.net</span></li>
  <li style="color: rgb(0, 0, 238);">issues@jai<span
 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 238);">-imageio</span>.dev.java.net</li>
  <li style="color: rgb(0, 0, 238);">cvs@jai<span
 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 238);">-imageio</span>.dev.java.net</li>
</ul>
<p><a
 href="http://jai-imageio.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectMailingListList">Click
here to subscribe</a> to any of these lists. </p>
<p>The <span style="font-style: italic;">announce</span> list is a
low-volume moderated mailing list for announcing Java Advanced Imaging
Image I/O Tools
related news and information. The <span style="font-style: italic;">interest</span>
list is an open mailing list for discussing all aspects of the Java
Advanced Imaging Image I/O Tools API, the&nbsp; implementation for the
Java
Advanced Imaging Image I/O Tools core, demo programs etc. The <span
 style="font-style: italic;">issues</span>
list is for automated issues tracking (for issues in the parent
jai-imageio web
pages only), and the <span style="font-style: italic;">cvs</span> list
is for automated CVS
change messages (for changes to the parent jai-imageio web pages only).</p>
<p>For those who prefer a forum to a mailing list, we have created the <a
 href="http://jai-imageio.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectForumView">Java
Advanced
Imaging Image I/O Tools API forum</a>, hosted as part of the
JavaDesktop Community.
Messages posted on the forum are cross-posted to <span
 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 238);">interest@jai-imageio.dev.java.net</span>
and
vice-versa.<br>
</p>
<p>Finally, in addition to the issues mailing list mentioned in the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Reporting Issues</span> section above,
each sub-project also has its own cvs mailing list.&nbsp;<a
 href="https://jai-imageio-core.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectMailingListList">Click
here to subscribe</a> to the cvs mailing list described below: </p>
<ul>
  <li> <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 238);">cvs@jai-imageio-core.dev.java.net</span>
list is for automated CVS change messages and discussion of those
changes </li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="Project_Highlights"></a>Project Highlights
</h3>
<p><b>Release project Source code</b> </p>
<p>The current Java Advanced Imaging Image I/O Tools source
code is the version 1.2. It is
available for download from the CVS repository of this project.
The&nbsp; <a href="https://jai-imageio.dev.java.net/cvs-tags.html">Java
Advanced Imaging Image I/O Tools CVS
tags page</a> lists the existing CVS tags and describes the naming
scheme used for these in the CVS repository. The root of this release
is
tagged as <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 238);">root-1_2</span> and the
latest version is tagged as <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 238);">jai-imageio-1_1-fcs</span>.
The latest version can be retrieved by simple cvs checkout command or
the tag can be
used to retrieve a specific version from the CVS repository.
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Java Advanced Imaging Image I/O
Tools </span><span style="font-weight: bold;"> bug
fixes</span><br>
</p>
<p>We will work with the community to address bugs identified in
Java Advanced Imaging Image I/O Tools
and will release new versions of Java Advanced Imaging Image
I/O Tools as needed.
Bug fixes will be immediately available in the CVS source, or from the
daily builds on this site. We
will release official versions as needed. 1.1-fcs has been
released and the release that we are currently working on is 1.2.<br>
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Java Advanced Imaging Image I/O
Tools 1.2</span><br>
</p>
<p>We intend to start work on
designing and implementing the next version of Java Advanced
Imaging Image I/O Tools.
The scope of this release will be driven by community members.
Suggestions for features to
include in the next major release
are of course welcome.</p>
